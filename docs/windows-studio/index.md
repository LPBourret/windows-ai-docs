# Windows Studio Overview (Preview)

Windows Studio applies AI effects that utilize the device camera (currently supported) or microphone (coming soon), including Background Blur, Background Segmentation, Eye Contact and Auto Framing.

Windows Studio standardizes control interfaces for camera and microphone so that any application can discover if AI effects are supported, accessing any available metadata and turning these features off if they are not supported.

Windows Studio leverages AI models built by Microsoft and compiled/optimized for device's with Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to deliver higher-fidelity, battery-friendly AI effects that reduce the burdon on the device CPU and GPU.
