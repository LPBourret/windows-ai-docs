# Windows Vision Skills (Preview)

Implementing and integrating efficient machine learning and computer vision solutions is a hard task for developers. The industry is moving at a fast pace and the amount of custom-tailored solutions coming out makes it strenuous for application developers to keep up. Existing APIs and lower-level frameworks add a steep learning curve before developers can leverage them effectively.

The **Windows Vision Skills** framework is meant to make it easier to utilize computer vision. It standardizes the way computer vision modules are put to use within a Windows application, running on the local device. It abstracts complexities into a single programming paradigm with standardized primitives, helping developers focus on building awesome computer vision applications.

![Diagram of how Windows Vision Skills fits into the development stack; starts with the bottom layer (GPU, CPU, VPU, etc); on top of that are hardware acceleration frameworks (DirectX, DirectML, and others); the next layer is the Windows Vision Skills API, consisting of Windows APIs and third-party frameworks; and the top layer consists of UWP, .NET Core, and Win32 applications](../images/vision-skills-diagram2-wide.png)

The implementation that contains the complex details is encapsulated by an extensible WinRT API that inherits the base classes and interfaces in the [Microsoft.AI.Skills.SkillInterfacePreview](/dotnet/api/microsoft.ai.skills.skillinterfacepreview) namespace. This API can be ingested by all types of Windows apps (UWP, .NET Core, and Win32). This framework is open for all developers to build on top of.

## What is a *skill*?

In the context of Windows Vision Skills, a skill is a streamlined, modular piece of code that processes input and produces output. A skill can encapsulate simple functionalities like edge detection with a single-purpose micro-skill, or rich sets of functionalities forming a scenario skill to address a complex problem like skeletal detection.

## Benefits

- **Simple integration**: Skills make it easy to add features to your application with out-of-the-box APIs that donâ€™t require any machine learning or computer vision expertise, or prior Windows knowledge of low-level APIs.

- **Abstracting hardware acceleration**: The Windows Vision Skills framework queries the hardware assets and provides OS provisions that allow developers to make efficient compute decisions at runtime.

- **Interoperability**: The framework works with OS interfaces and assets such as image primitives from cameras, photos, and video, and it can be used in conjunction with the [Windows Machine Learning APIs](../windows-ml/overview.md).

- **NuGet packages**: Windows Vision Skills is strongly versioned to ease iteration without breaking existing applications. They are easy to ingest, easy to update, and they preserve intellectual property through licensing.

- **Extensibility**: The framework can be easily extended to work with existing machine learning frameworks and libraries such as **OpenCV**.

- **Modularity**: Skills can be pieced together in succession within an application just like a recipe to address a complex scenario. Skills can also be bundled together in a single package by the developer.

While this preview focuses on vision-oriented scenarios and primitives, the API is meant to accommodate a wide range of input and output variables that enable audio processing, text processing, and more.
